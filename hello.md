## Hello Kari
### Heading Three
> This class basically follows the textbook covering a chapter per week.
>
> The book provides a great `skeleton` for the course flow. Individual instructors
> are encouraged to add their own `meat/flesh` based on their personal experience and beliefs.
>
> Some chapters may require additional course time to ensure important concepts
> are understood. Don't sweat it. Cover what you believe is important for students
> to understand about SQL.
>
> And **have fun!!!**
